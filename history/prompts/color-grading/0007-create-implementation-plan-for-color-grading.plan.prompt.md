## Prompt



## Response snapshot

I have completed the planning phase for the 'color-grading' feature. This included creating the implementation plan, research document, data model, API contracts, and a quickstart guide. The agent context has also been updated.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High
- 🧪 Tests: None
- 📁 Files: 5 created/modified
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The planning phase produced a comprehensive set of artifacts that will guide the implementation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
