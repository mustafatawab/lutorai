## Prompt



## Response snapshot

I have generated the `tasks.md` file with a detailed breakdown of the implementation tasks for the color grading feature. The tasks are organized by user story and follow a test-driven development approach.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High
- 🧪 Tests: None
- 📁 Files: 1 created/modified
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: The generated tasks provide a clear and actionable plan for the implementation phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a
